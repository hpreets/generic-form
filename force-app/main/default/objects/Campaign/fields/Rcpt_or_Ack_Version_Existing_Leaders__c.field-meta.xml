    <description>Membership sends this text value to its receipt/acknowledgement mailshop when a donor already in Membership&apos;s Leadership Team gives a gift. The various text values indicate which receipt/acknowledgement version the mailshop should send, based on the entity, campaign, whether it is a donor-advised-fund grant, and any other relevant criteria. The text values are arranged between Membership Communications and its mailshop, so the mailshop knows by this value which version to send.</description>
