    <description>Membership sends this text value to its receipt/acknowledgement mailshop when a donor gives their first gift to EDF and it&apos;s at Membership&apos;s Leadership Team level. The various text values indicate which receipt/acknowledgement version the mailshop should send, based on the entity, campaign, whether it is a donor-advised-fund grant, and any other relevant criteria. The text values are arranged between Membership Communications and its mailshop, so the mailshop knows by this value which version to send.</description>
