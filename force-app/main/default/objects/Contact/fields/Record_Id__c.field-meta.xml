    <description>We have 2 fields to support continuing the Contact ID number values from LCRM in NPSP (Contact Autonumber Backup and Record ID). When a record has a blank value in Contact Autonumber Backup and a value in Record ID, it was a migrated record from LCRM. When a record has a value in both fields and they don&apos;t match, it means the record was created during the Delta. It has a value in the Contact Autonumber Backup field, but it was created in LCRM, so it retains that value. When the field values match, it is an entirely new record.</description>
